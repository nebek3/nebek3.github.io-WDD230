                    <h3>Named "The Hub City"</h3>
                    <p>The town site of Wendell was chosen for the vast expanse of grass where sagebrush 
                        had been burned off by wildfires several years earlier. When the town site was 
                        surveyed, W.S. Kuhn name it after his 15 year old son, Wendel Speer Kuhn. No one 
                        knows when the town was named “Wendell” but when the village was dedicated in 
                        Lincoln County in July 1908, it was spelt with two “L”s. The town was laid out 
                        in July 1907 with certain blocks set aside for schools are parks. Main Street 
                        was plotted east and west, but the town grew along Idaho Street, south toward the 
                        railroad tracks.
                    </p>
                    <p>By August 1909, the North Side News described Wendell as a ‘prosperous town of a 
                        year’s growth’ and pointed out that the new town is located with Gooding twelve 
                        miles north, Jerome twelve miles east, Hagerman
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>Valley twelve miles west and “on 
                        the south ‘an Empire’.” By the paper’s calculation there were 75,000 acres of 
                        fertile farm land around the town. This centralized location prompted Major Fred 
                        R. Reed to nickname his adopted home ‘The Hub City’.
                    </p>
                    <p>When Twin Falls approached its Golden Anniversary, civic leaders felt their town 
                        should ‘officially’ be designated the “Hub City”, stating that Twin Falls was the 
                        geographic and commercial center of the Magic Valley. While Wendell’s growth had 
                        lagged behind Twin Falls, the town fought to keep the historic designation that 
                        was a matter of civic pride. Former mayor R.D. Bradshaw took the problem to Idaho’s 
                        congressional delegation. It was discovered that the naming of Wendell as the Hub 
                        City had been read into the congressional record during Frank R. Gooding’s term as 
                        Senator and so, based on historic evidence, Wendell was official designated “The 
                        Hub City of Magic Valley”.
